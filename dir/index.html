			<h2>What is taking so long?</h2>
			<p>I would love to share the craziness that I'm working on at the moment but I have to get the entire back end constructed first before I can host just the stuff I've BEEN working on, let alone the stuff that I'm doing right now (v5 in particular).
			<h2>It's just a server though...</h2>
			<p>Exactly, it's just a loud piece of hardware that doesn't know how to do anything. I had to install everything on it, including the hardware, just so I can start testing things for deployment, just so I can start hosting snippets like this just so I can be sure I can actually host the stuff I want to host in the manner I want to host it. That's all before I even finish creating the stuff I want to host. mmmm dat production timeline...
			<h2>What have you done thus far then?</h2>
			<p>Since putting together the server itself (it was purchased as individual components), I've installed WinServer 2012, SSH server, FTP Server, Node.js, MongoDB, Python, MinGW, JRE, and then got all the firewall stuff squared away just in time for me to break the class path so bad trying to make a windows service I had to do it again. The second time was MUCH much quicker. Since the second install of my pieces, I have most of a full web-server created with node. I'm working with my custom libraries I made with another project and adding exception handling, graceful degradation, logging, and some nice little features I would have liked the first time around. Still just working on SERVING the stuff though.
			<h2>How long until v5?</h2>
			<p>iunno... seriously. This is my first attempt at solo hosting. First attempt at a node web-server. First time creating daemon services. First time doing lots of things. Even v4 was only 3/4ths down with PhP, looked pretty bad still so it's going to need some love. In the mean time you can see the 'shape' of the new webby <a href="http://thilly.net/NewWebby/newIndex.html"> over here.</a> As you can see I'm going for an endless vertical scroll. I'll try to flat design, and ALL of the design, color scheme, picture locations, and how the comments are delivered are completely temporary. Just so I can see the general shape of my new business. I also want to create a new template for my new webby. A third stab at my CMS should be pretty nice.
			<h2>Well, fine, do that then</h2>
			<p>Roger that buddy, for now, view source and take a peek at some of the client JS source that I've put together if you really want to see something new. Not much but, it's got a couple of really weak tests in there. Mostly just checking my exceptions and making sure I don't kill/hang the browser on a bad request. No server side stuff to show, just have to take my word for it that it's cool.
			'til next time :D
