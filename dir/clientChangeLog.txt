ChangeLog - Thilly.net V5 - Client 

12 June 2014 - Complete redesign of layout and initial creation of framework

Made it somewhat emulate the document/minimap thing of sublime text type navigation.
	
	Layout:
		implemented splashImg 100% window size
		implemented sticky header bar immediately following splashImg
		implemented single page of content, 'endless' scroll
		implemented minimap on left for thumbs of content (like v4)
		implemented pointers to current content in minimap
		
	Interaction:
		implemented normalization between minimap and content pane on click / drag / scroll
		implemented ability to add additional articles
		
	Design:
		no final theme implementations at this time
		only colored to show structure
		
	toDo:
		pull the movement functions out of index.js, put in controls.js (or something) and namespace them to a global object to clean up the JS structure some

		attach to mongo for actual articles
		
		clean up design with something nice
			ide type colors, dark theme, light theme
