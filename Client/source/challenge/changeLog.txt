ChangeLog - Challenge v2 (integrated)

5 April 2015 - Forgot about this
	I completely forgot about the changelog for the contest. It's been moving along quite a bit actually:
	
	-multiple languages supported : JS/Java/C++
	-integrated with mongoDB for saving attempts/success
	-integrated with mongoDB for uploading/modifying/activating current problems
	-new problem sets created
	

2 Aug 2014  - Getting back into it
	Haven't touched the contest in quite a while. It served its purpose as it is but now it's time to migrate it into this webApp
	Committed old stuff into git, starting from nearly nothing with the webApp integration.
	
	things that will change:
		moving to Mongo for storage and thilly.net user integration
		bringing contest specific news and what-not into the feed
		hopefully get it running with JS/Java submissions as well
		add functionality to add problems using the template
	
	things planned to reuse:
		most of the shape/structure of the old app (login screen, contest layout, etc)
		the overall flow with the contests, chat, user/admin assistance
