ChangeLog - Thilly.net V5 - Web Service

8 June 2014 - Start logging development to not loose track of progress

Began trying to make an extensible web service to act as a webServer, fileHandler, and CMS

	webService.js:
		-implemented node(http) to listen for web requests using thillyFiles.fileHandler to serve
		-implemented socket.io to create two way communication (no ajax/PhP)
		-implemented some basic functions I find myself writing again and again
			actionCommand, sendCommand
			
	thillyExceptions.js:
		-implemented basic error handling (place holder ATM)
		
	thillyFiles.js:
		-implemented wrappers with logging around node(fs) library
		-implemented filehandler for most common requests, can be extended for more file types
		
	thillyLogging.js:
		-implemented basic logging object to easily watch certain aspects of the process
		-implemented ability to log out to a file to see what or if anything happened while not watching server
		
	Other:
		Created service to start automatically when server is powered on.
		
	toDo:
	extend fileHandler to account for streams and any other file types that come up
	extend thillyExceptions to handle errors cleanly (or at least provide the illusion of doing so)
	create supervisory process to 'watch' webService, contest, and other node processes
	create external 'classes' for different states of socket commands
	implement v5 flow and shape
	implement CMS
	implement mongoDB delivery or content
