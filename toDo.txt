toDo:
	extend fileHandler to account for streams and any other file types that come up
	extend thillyExceptions to handle errors cleanly (or at least provide the illusion of doing so)
	create supervisory process to 'watch' webService, contest, and other node processes
	create external 'classes' for different states of socket commands
	implement CMS
	re-write mongoLib
	finish up exception handling
	give thillyLogging hooks to modify logging from outside hardcoded values
	generalize page requests
